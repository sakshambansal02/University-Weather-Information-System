# University-Weather-Information-System

I'm excited to introduce you to my project, the University Weather Information System. It's a JavaScript-based system I've developed to fetch and present weather data specifically for university locations. Here's a rundown of what I've put together:

<br> 

What's Inside:
<br>

fetchCurrentTemperature.js: This is where I pull the current temperature for a given location. Pretty handy for quick checks!
<br>
fetchGeoCoord.js: I use this to get the geographical coordinates for any location. It's crucial for accurate weather data retrieval.
<br>
fetchUniversities.js: Here, I fetch details about various universities, including their names and locations.
<br>
universityWeather.js: This is where everything comes together. I combine the functionalities of the other modules to show specific weather information for universities.
<br>
utility.js: Contains all the utility functions I use across the project.
<br>
main.js: The heart of the application - this is where everything starts.

Testing:
I've focused on making the tests comprehensive, ensuring they cover edge cases and error handling as well. This is to maintain high-quality code and to make future maintenance easier. Running these tests regularly is part of my development process to catch any issues early and to make sure that new changes don't break existing functionalities.
